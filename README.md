# SDL2-Project
## Preface
### This project was submitted on freshman second semester, to Mr. Mohammed, our Computer programming-I instructor of the time.
### The submission date was set a few days after the final exam.
### Being the least absurd and the only one with a valid SDLC research of all 10 project ideas proposed by all 10 members, it was chosen as the group's project.
### It was initially planned to be a 2D video game/engine, but having feared potential denial of collaboration from group members who would take difficulty of the operation and feasibility as an excuse, it was modified.
### After some well deserved thoughts, it was named "Hybrid-designs". 
### This is because it combines both console (regular terminal usage) with Graphical user interface (GUI usage).
### However, noone in the group could understand the main purpose or the meaning of the project. It was explained repeatedly both in person and online to all group members, but failed to get the appropriate attention.
### Thus, the project was forced to be do alone and used the flexibility of the project was used to pursue on the initial plan.
### However, because of lack of support from the group, difficulty of the implementations and final exam preparations, the initial plan failed and the project was submitted as cluster of simple programs that use the hybrid designs concept.
### The sad failure of this project teaches a lesson about the inequality and incompatibility of energy and attitude between group members as well as the fruit of keeping things simple especially if it's not that worth it.
